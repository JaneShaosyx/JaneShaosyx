### Hi there I'm Jane!ðŸ‘‹
I am currently a computer science graduate school student in Burnaby. I love thinking, taking photos, and playing video games. I started my coding journey back to my high school and went to McGill University to study software engineering after that. Now I am pursuing my master degree in big data area at Simon Fraser University. Nice to meet you!
